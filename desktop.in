# These variables configure the build of Arbor, specifically which architecture to target

# Set to ON if targeting NVIDIA GPU.
# Arbor requires minimum CUDA 9
arb_gpu=OFF

# CPU architecture to target (still set this if targetting GPU)
# This corresponds to the GNU equivalent -march argument, e.g.
#   native, broadwell, haswell, skylake, knl, skylake-512
arb_arch=native

# Whether to use SIMD template library: set to ON if the target architecture supports
# one of AVX, AVX2 or AVX512.
arb_vectorize=ON

# Set the MPI compiler wrappers
# These should use either of
#   * gcc >= 6.0
#   * clang >= 4.0
# Note that CUDA will restrict which gcc version can be used.
